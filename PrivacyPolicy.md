Privacy Policy for Inflation Compass
Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how "Inflation Compass" (hereinafter referred to as "the App"), developed by Inflation Compass, collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Service. The App is designed to help you consult global inflation data, compare economic indicators across countries, and monitor personalized item lists for inflation.

By choosing to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The information we collect is primarily used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible within the App or on our website [Your Website URL, if applicable], unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use
For a better experience while using our Service, we may collect certain information.

We do not directly collect personally identifiable information such as your name, gender, or pictures. However, if you choose to register for an account within the App, we will collect your email address. Registration is optional.

All other data, including personalized item lists, device information, and usage data, is processed and stored exclusively on your device. This data is not transmitted to our servers by the App itself. This may include:

Personalized Item Lists: The items you add to your monitoring lists are stored locally on your device to provide this core functionality. This data is not linked to your personal identity.

The App may rely on third-party services (e.g., analytics providers, data APIs) that may collect non-personally identifiable information and device identifiers as described in their respective privacy policies. Please note that payment information for App purchases is handled directly by the app store (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store) and is not collected or stored by us.

Local Storage and Device Identifiers
This Service does not explicitly use web browser "cookies." However, the App may utilize device identifiers, local storage, or similar technologies through third-party code and libraries to collect information and to improve their services, such as analytics or crash reporting. These technologies may collect information to identify your device or provide aggregated usage data. You typically have options to manage device identifiers through your device settings.

Location Information
Our Service does not collect or process your precise geographical location data for its core functionalities (inflation consultation, comparison, or item monitoring). However, standard device information collected by third-party analytics services might include general region or country information derived from IP addresses, which is not used to identify you personally.

Service Providers
We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:

To facilitate our Service;

To provide the Service on our behalf;

To perform Service-related services (e.g., maintenance, data analysis); or

To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties may have access to your collected information (as described above). The reason for this access is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

Security
We value your trust in providing us with your information, and we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy
This Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
